This Python script creates a simple library management system using the Tkinter library for the GUI and SQLite for the database. The system allows users to add books to the library, issue books to users, and return books to the library. The main components of the system are:

GUI Components: The GUI is created using Tkinter, with labels, entry fields, and buttons for adding, issuing, and returning books. A Treeview widget is used to display the list of books in a table format.

Database: SQLite is used as the database backend. A table named books is created with columns for id, title, author, status, and card_id. The status column indicates whether the book is available or not.

Functionality: The add_book, issue_book, and return_book methods handle the corresponding actions. The display_books method retrieves all books from the database and populates the Treeview widget. The clear_entries method clears the input fields after adding a book.

Main Loop: The script creates an instance of the LibraryManagementSystem class and starts the Tkinter main loop.

Overall, this script provides a basic library management system with functionality for adding, issuing, and returning books.
